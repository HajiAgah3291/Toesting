## Retro Ping Pong Game

This repository includes a simple retro ping pong game implemented in HTML5 and JavaScript. To play the game locally, open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Use the **W** and **S** keys to move the left paddle and the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to move the right paddle.

Press **P** or tap the screen to pause and resume. On mobile devices drag on the left or right half of the canvas to control the corresponding paddle.

The first player to score wins!

If you still wish to run the older Python version, ensure Python 3 and the `pygame` package are installed and run `python ping_pong.py`.
